CHANGELOG 0.8.102

    Sublime Text needs to be restarted for the changes to work.
    
    NEW: gj and gk in visual mode.
    FIX: Improve implementation of gj, gk.

        NOTES:
        gj and gk rely extensively on Sublime Text native commands
        and currently have limitations in terms of Vim behavior.

    FIX: Enable repeating insertions in replace mode.
    FIX: Esc after o or O removes whitespace in some cases.
    FIX: Add jump after goto_definition (F12). The jump is added even if goto_definition is cancelled.
