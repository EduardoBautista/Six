    // WELCOME /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    /////////// TO /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    /////////////// SIX.NEXT ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    
    You are on the dev release channel of Six.
    
    You are now using Six.Next, a partial reimplementation of Six.
    
    
    SIX.NEXT IS INCOMPLETE
    
    Six.Next is under active development. You may encounter bugs often and you may
    temporarily miss features available today in Six.Current.
    
    (Six.Next is already being used to develop Six.Next.)
    
    If you want to use the most stable version of Six, make sure to use the stable
    release channel.
    
        More information: http://docs.sublimesix.com/
    
    
    SIX.NEXT IS THE FUTURE
    
    As soon as Six.Next reaches feature parity with Six.Current, it will become
    Six 1.0.
    
    Notable missing features:
    
        * Plugins
        * Mappings
    
    
    SIX.CURRENT AND SIX.NEXT SIDE BY SIDE
    
    Six.Current and Six.Next are executing side by side in this release channel. If
    you want to switch between the two, press
        
        * Shift+Esc
    
    (If that key binding is overriden in your User/Default.sublime-keymap or
    otherwise, it will not work. If Six.Next crashes at start-up, that key binding
    won't be available either.)
    
    Note that Six.Current from the stable release channel is still more stable than
    the Six.Current version available in side-by-side execution.
    
    
    DEBUGGING
    
    If you want to report a bug for Six.Next, you may want to include the debug
    output from the Sublime Text console after enabling Six.Next's debug mode using
    the 'Six: Toggle Debug' command from the command palette.
    
    
    Thank you for using Six!
