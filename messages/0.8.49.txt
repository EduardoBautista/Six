CHANGELOG 0.8.49

    Sublime Text needs to be restarted for the changes to work.

    NEW: enable i_CTRL-C (ctrl+c in insert mode).

        NOTES:

            This key binding will override the ability to copy text on Windows
            in insert mode if `enable_ctrl_keys` is set to `True` via the Six
            settings file (see Command Palette entry).

            If you prefer the standard Windows behavior, you can create the following key
            binding for it in your User/Default.sublime-keymap file:

            { "keys": ["ctrl+c"], "command": "copy" }

    FIX: swith to normal mode if the user clicks on the view while in
         multile selection (gh) or multitple line selection (gH) modes.
