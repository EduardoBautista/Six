        TL;DR
    
        Six's dev channel will become more unstable for a while. Switch to
        the stable channel if you need to. See http://docs.sublimesix.com/ for more
        information.
    
        ===
    
        SIX.NEXT IS COMING TO THE DEV CHANNEL
    
    	Six's dev channel will start delivering Six.Next in the near future.
    
    	Six.Next currently lacks many features available today in Six.Current.
    
    	If you want to keep using Six.Current until Six.Next reaches feature parity,
    	make sure that you don't have the following setting in your Package Control
    	User settings:
    
    		"install_prereleases": ["Six"]
    
    	See http://docs.sublimesix.com/ for more information.
    
    	Six.Next will coexist with Six.Current in the dev branch for a time. This
    	means that you will be able to switch between the two with a keyboard shortcut.
    	However, both are going to be more unstable than Six.Current from the stable
    	channel.
