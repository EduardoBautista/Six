    // ANNOUNCEMENT ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    
    You are on the dev release channel of Six.
    
    You are now using Six.Next, a partial reimplementation of Six.
    
    
    SIX.NEXT IS THE FUTURE
    
    As soon as Six.Next reaches feature parity with Six.Current, it will become
    Six 1.0.
    
    
    SIX.CURRENT AND SIX.NEXT SIDE BY SIDE
    
    Six.Current and Six.Next are executing side by side in this release channel. If
    you want to switch between the two, press
    
    * Shift+Esc
    
    (If that key binding is overriden in your User/Default.sublime-keymap or
    otherwise, it will not work. If Six.Next crashes at start-up, that key binding
    won't be available either.)
    
    Note that Six.Current from the stable release channel is still more stable than
    the Six.Current version available in side-by-side execution.
    
    
    DEBUGGING
    
    If you want to report a bug for Six.Next, you may want to include the debug
    output from the Sublime Text console after enabling Six.Next's debug mode using
    the 'Six: Toggle Debug' command from the command palette.
    
    
    Thank you for using Six!
    
    Guillermo

    NEW: Add surround plugin.
    
    You can use ds( to delete parenthesis surrounding text, or cs([ to substitute
    a set of parenthesis with square brackets. Other delimiters also work with
    these operators.
